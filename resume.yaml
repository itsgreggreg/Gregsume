          description: Alpha-Mouse is my ever-ongoing consulting and creative agency. Through Alpha-Mouse I've done consulting for various companies
            such as PaperlessPost.com but mainly work on personal startup and creative endeavors like building photobooths or visualizing income levels.
            I also do the occasional logo or illustration commission as my Graphic Design degree haunts me.
            Currently I find myself elbows deep making the world of postcard organization better through technology over at HowdyHi.com.
            I realize it makes very little sense, but start sending postcards... you'll get it. :)

          description: I Co-Founded a consulting business in NYC where we focused on building prototypes and minimum viable products for
            startups. We built many mobile applications, web applications and API layers for clients ranging from social video sharing community myblocknyc.com
            to a mobile based micro site creator for business owners. Within a year of operations we had created a profitable and successful
            consulting operation in New York City.

          dates: May 2011 - January 2012
          description: At K2 Media Labs I was many different roles to many different teams. Working at an incubator saw me writing a 3D music explorer in 
            Actionscript 3, building the front end of a daily deals website in Google Web Toolkit, writing the backend of an image sharing social media website
            in Ruby and contributing various bugfixes and updates to a social discovery "who's around me" type mobile app. Being a collection of startups that
            didn't succeed I've got very little to show for it other than stories of super late nights with other coworkers. :( But such is life in the NYC start up world!

          title: India Team Liaison and Webstore Developer
          dates: October 2009 - November 2010
          description: When Lime Wire needed to kick their outsourcing into overdrive for the rapid development of a new music service
            I leapt at the opportunity to be the India team liaison and dev lead. In this role I facilitated effective communication between
            multiple teams thousands of miles apart, identified inefficiencies in outsourcing strategies, maintained clear understanding of
            team goals and expectations and managed the delivery of software from a team overseas on a strict deadline. This job saw me make
            a 3 week trip to New Delhi to meet and code with the team as well as eat some of the best food I've ever had.
            This was probably the most fun I've had at work and I miss those guys.

          title: Informations Systems Interface Developer
          dates: October 2009 - November 2010
          description: I was brought into Lime Wire to write an analytics dashboard and set of visualizations for the massive amount
            of data they were bringing in. I wrote an Adobe Flex based application capable of loading in configurable analytics modules
            that tied in with the companies identity server to allow employees to securely log in and save dashboard configurations. When Lime Wire
            kickstarted work on what would be an online music purchasing and streaming service, I was called upon to construct prototypes
            in Adobe Air as well as QT and was put on the fledgling team of core developers for the new project. We were tasked with creating
            the brand new music service's minimum viable product and for this project I was both scrum master and lead QT developer.

            My employment at Adroit Interactive saw me re-write their realtime, targeted ad delivery system in Actionscript 2.
            Working in the confines of "As small as possible" and "As compatible as possible" I built a servable ad unit capable
            of on the fly scripting of images, components, actionables, fonts, and a whole bunch of other things. I rode my Puch
            to work every day.

            I was brought onto Our Stage as a Junior Developer to build various components in Actionscript 3.
            I build a real time DJ multicasting app, updated and maintained their chat application, and contributed
            various features and bug fixes to the main webapp in Ruby. I also bough my first two wheeled motor vehicle from a coworker there.
